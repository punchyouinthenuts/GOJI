<ul>
    <li>One compares counts from original input files to the final sorted counts</li>
    <li>The other will have all of the data you need for counts and postage
        <ul>
            <li>Click the <i>Copy</i> button to copy the second table</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Open the email for this job
        <ul>
            <li><i>Reply All</i> to the message. Right-click in the email body and click <i>Paste</i>. This will paste the table into the email body.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Go to the Windows Explorer window with the ZIP files
        <ul>
            <li>Select all of the ZIP files, then drag those to the email and drop them there to attach them</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Once all of the proof ZIP files have uploaded to the email click <i>Send</i></li>
</ul>

<p>You are now in the <i>Proof Approval</i> phase. Save the job, and close if necessary. You will receive an email with proof approval status for each job. For each job that is completely approved check its box under <b>PROOF APPROVAL</b>. If all are approved simply click <i>All</i>. If any are not approved and require changes, follow the steps below:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Select the proof files you need to open using <b>OPEN PROOF FILES</b> and the drop down menu below it. Close any files you do not need to make any changes to.
        <ul>
            <li>Make necessary corrections and save as normal, overwriting the original files (if they are needed in the future, they still exist in the original proof ZIP files)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Click on <b>PROOF REGEN LOCK</b>, and select only the proof files you made updates/corrections to</li>
    <li>Click <b>RUN POST PROOF</b>
        <ul>
            <li>This will generate new ZIP files that contain only the proofs you regenerated. They will have a vX identifier appended to the end of their file names.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Click on <b>PROOF REGEN LOCK</b> to disengage it</li>
    <li>Reply to the email and attach those updated ZIP files only, updating the <b>PROOF APPROVAL</b> section accordingly</li>
</ul>
